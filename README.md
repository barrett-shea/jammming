### About:

Jammming was built as Codeacademy's capstone project: "Build Front-End Web Applications from Scratch". CSS and HTML snippetts were originally provided for each component. I refactored the HTML into JSX. Javascript and React components were built from plain English, step-by-step instructions. An example instruction was: "Pass the state of the App component's searchResults to the SearchResults component." CSS styling was further customized upon completion.
